# Wyrmsign Generator

Wyrmsign is a syllabarium parser that converts latin text into a fictional alphabet. Each symbol in this alphabet is a complete syllable. Two vowels in a row result in a long vowel, while two consonants result in a consonant break. The hexagons are tesselated side by side, creating a seamless language that flows from character to character.
To create an image, write your text in a .txt file, then run the code on the same directory. Once complete, the code will generat your text as result.png.

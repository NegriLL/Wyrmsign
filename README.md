# Wyrmsign Generator

Wyrmsign is a syllabarium parser that converts latin text into a fictional alphabet. Each symbol in this alphabet is a complete syllable. Two vowels in a row result in a long vowel, while two consonants result in a consonant break. The hexagons are tesselated side by side, creating a seamless language that flows from character to character.
To create an image, write your text in the text.txt file (or change the target file name in settings.ini), then run the code on the same directory. Once complete, the code will generat your image aand save it as result.png.
